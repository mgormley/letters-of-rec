Dear Members of the Admissions Committee,

I am writing to provide my strongest recommendation for [STUDENT_NAME_1]'s application to the PhD program in Computer Science at Stanford University. I have known [STUDENT_NAME_1] for two and a half years, first as a student in my Introduction to Machine Learning course and subsequently as a teaching assistant for my machine learning courses and as a research assistant in my group. [He/She] is among the most capable and promising undergraduate researchers I have worked with, combining strong technical skills, intellectual curiosity, and research maturity that is rare at this stage. Based on my experience, I am confident that [STUDENT_NAME_1] is well-prepared for PhD-level work and will make significant contributions to the field of machine learning.

[STUDENT_NAME_1] first stood out to me as an exceptional student in my Introduction to Machine Learning course (10-301) in Fall 2022, where [he/she] earned an A and placed in the top 10% of a class of 280 students. What distinguished [STUDENT_NAME_1] was not just strong performance on exams and homework, but the depth of understanding evident in [his/her] work. For example, in one homework assignment, [he/she] not only completed the required implementation but included a creative extension using attention mechanisms, demonstrating initiative and an ability to connect ideas across different topics. [STUDENT_NAME_1] continued this trajectory in my more advanced course (10-601) in Fall 2023, where [he/she] ranked in the top 5% of 180 students. On the final exam, [his/her] explanation of backpropagation was exceptionally clear, showing both mathematical rigor and intuitive understanding. This strong academic foundation—evidenced by a 3.92 overall GPA and particularly high marks in technical courses—has prepared [him/her] well for graduate-level work.

Beyond coursework, [STUDENT_NAME_1] has been an outstanding teaching assistant for three semesters in my Introduction to Machine Learning and Machine Learning courses. [His/Her] student feedback ratings averaged 4.8 out of 5.0, placing [him/her] among the top two TAs each semester out of approximately 15-20 teaching assistants. During office hours, [STUDENT_NAME_1] employs a Socratic teaching style, guiding students to discover solutions rather than simply providing answers. One particularly memorable example occurred when a struggling student came to [his/her] office hours confused about backpropagation and close to giving up. [STUDENT_NAME_1] spent 90 minutes patiently building intuition through hand-drawn diagrams and simple examples. The student later wrote to say this was the first time the concept had truly "clicked" after weeks of struggling. In addition to teaching effectiveness, [STUDENT_NAME_1] has made technical contributions to our courses, including developing an interactive visualization tool for understanding gradient descent that has since been incorporated into our official course materials and used by over 400 students. This combination of pedagogical skill and technical contribution is rare among undergraduate TAs.

[STUDENT_NAME_1]'s research work has been the strongest indicator of [his/her] readiness for a PhD program. [He/She] joined my research group in January 2023 to work on parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for large language models. Initially, [STUDENT_NAME_1] worked under close supervision, implementing several existing approaches including LoRA and adapter methods, and creating a unified framework to evaluate their performance. By mid-2023, [he/she] had progressed to largely independent work, designing systematic experiments to identify key factors affecting the success of these methods. Most impressively, in Fall 2023, [STUDENT_NAME_1] proposed a novel hybrid approach that combines benefits of different fine-tuning methods. [He/She] implemented and tested this method independently, achieving a 30% reduction in training time compared to existing approaches while maintaining comparable performance. This work resulted in a co-authored paper submitted to NeurIPS 2024, in which [STUDENT_NAME_1] served as the primary implementer, ran all experiments, and co-wrote the methods and results sections. The codebase [he/she] developed has been released as an open-source library that has gained over 250 GitHub stars and is being used by several other research groups. What is particularly notable about [STUDENT_NAME_1]'s research trajectory is the clear progression from guided work to genuine independence over the course of 18 months—[he/she] now comes to our meetings with completed work and thoughtful proposals for next steps, operating at a level comparable to a strong first or second-year PhD student.

In summary, [STUDENT_NAME_1] combines intellectual depth, strong technical skills, and demonstrated research ability in a way that distinguishes [him/her] from the majority of undergraduate applicants. In the past five years, I have written strong letters of recommendation for approximately ten students applying to top PhD programs. [STUDENT_NAME_1] ranks among the top three of those students. Two of those students are now thriving in PhD programs at Stanford and MIT, and I believe [STUDENT_NAME_1] compares favorably to both. [His/Her] research interests in parameter-efficient methods for large models align well with several groups at Stanford, and I am confident [he/she] will make valuable contributions to your program. I give [STUDENT_NAME_1] my highest recommendation without reservation. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like additional information.

Sincerely,

- Combining academic and teaching paragraphs (focus on most impressive aspects)
- Shortening research paragraph slightly (fewer implementation details)
- Keeping opening and closing similar

### MS Program Version
For MS applications, would adjust by:
- Emphasizing coursework and practical skills more heavily
- De-emphasizing research independence (still mention project)
- Focusing on readiness for advanced study or industry roles
- Adjusting recommendation strength if appropriate
