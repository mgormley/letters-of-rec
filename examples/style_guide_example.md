## Letter Structure Patterns

### Opening Paragraph (100-120 words)

**Pattern 1: Direct recommendation**
```
I am writing to recommend [STUDENT_NAME] for [PROGRAM] at [INSTITUTION].
I have known [STUDENT_NAME] for [TIME_PERIOD] in my capacity as [RELATIONSHIP].
[One-sentence summary of strongest quality]. Based on my experience working
with [STUDENT_NAME], I am confident that [he/she/they] will excel in your program.
```

**Pattern 2: Enthusiastic opening**
```

application to [PROGRAM]. [STUDENT_NAME] served as [ROLE] in my [COURSE] course
and has been working with me on [PROJECT] since [DATE]. [He/She/They] is
[HEADLINE_QUALITY] and I recommend [him/her/them] without hesitation.
```

### Body Paragraphs: Evidence Organization

**For PhD Applications:**

1. Teaching effectiveness + student impact
2. Subject mastery + communication skills
3. Responsibility + reliability

### Closing Paragraph (50-80 words)

**Pattern 1: Strong recommendation**
```
In summary, [STUDENT_NAME] combines [QUALITY_1], [QUALITY_2], and [QUALITY_3]
in a way that is rare among [COHORT]. I give [him/her/them] my highest
recommendation without reservation. Please feel free to contact me if you have
any questions.
```

**Pattern 2: Enthusiastic with invitation**
```
I am confident that [STUDENT_NAME] will be an outstanding addition to your
program and will make significant contributions to [FIELD/RESEARCH_AREA].
I recommend [him/her/them] enthusiastically. I welcome the opportunity to
discuss [his/her/their] qualifications in more detail.
```

## Specific Content Patterns

### Describing Coursework Performance

**Good examples:**
- "In my Introduction to Machine Learning course (10-301), [STUDENT] earned an A, placing in the top 15% of a class of 300 students."
- "[STUDENT]'s homework submissions consistently demonstrated both technical correctness and conceptual depth, often including creative extensions beyond the assignment requirements."
- "On the final exam, [STUDENT] provided an exceptionally clear explanation of backpropagation that showed both mathematical rigor and intuitive understanding."

**Avoid:**
- "Did very well in my class"
- "Was a top student" (without quantification)
- Listing grades without context

### Describing Teaching Assistant Work

**Good examples:**
- "[STUDENT] held office hours for 6 hours per week and was consistently rated among the top 3 TAs by student feedback, with an average rating of 4.7/5.0."
- "During [SEMESTER], [STUDENT] developed a visualization tool for understanding gradient descent that clarified a concept many students struggle with. The tool has since been incorporated into the course materials."
- "When a critical bug was discovered in the autograder two days before the homework deadline, [STUDENT] worked with me to identify the issue, propose a fix, and communicate clearly with affected students."

**Avoid:**
- "Was a great TA"
- "Students liked [him/her/them]" (without evidence)
- Vague claims about "going above and beyond"

### Describing Research Contributions

**Good examples:**
- "[STUDENT] implemented three different approaches to [PROBLEM], systematically evaluated their performance, and identified the key factors affecting success. This work resulted in a co-authored paper submitted to [CONFERENCE]."
- "Initially, [STUDENT] worked under close supervision, but by the second month, [he/she/they] was proposing novel experiments and implementing them independently. [His/Her/Their] final contribution required minimal revision."
- "The codebase [STUDENT] developed is now used by our entire research group and has been released as an open-source library with 200+ GitHub stars."

**Avoid:**
- "Worked on important research"
- "Made significant contributions" (without specifics)
- Overstating authorship or independence

### Describing Personal Qualities

**Good examples:**
- "[STUDENT]'s emails are consistently clear and well-organized, making collaboration efficient. [He/She/They] documents code thoroughly and writes detailed summaries of experimental results."
- "When results initially did not match our expectations, [STUDENT] systematically debugged the implementation, identified a subtle error in the data preprocessing, and proposed improvements to prevent similar issues."
- "During a challenging debugging session, [STUDENT] remained patient and methodical, ultimately discovering an edge case that none of us had considered."

**Avoid:**
- "Good communication skills"
- "Handles challenges well"
- Personal qualities without concrete evidence

## Calibration: Recommendation Strength

### Tier 1: Exceptional (top 5%)
- "one of the very best students/TAs/researchers I have worked with"
- "I give [him/her/them] my highest recommendation without reservation"
- "I am confident [he/she/they] will make significant contributions to [field]"
- "exceptional combination of [qualities]"
- "rare among [cohort]"

### Tier 2: Strong (top 10-20%)
- "one of the stronger students in my experience"
- "I recommend [him/her/them] enthusiastically"
- "will be a strong addition to your program"
- "very capable" + specific evidence
- "compares favorably to successful PhD students"

### Tier 3: Good (top 30%)
- "I am pleased to recommend"
- "will perform well in your program"
- "has demonstrated solid capabilities"
- "would make a good addition to your program"
- More emphasis on potential than proven track record

### Calibration Markers

Include specific comparisons:
- "In the past 5 years, I have supervised approximately 50 teaching assistants. [STUDENT] ranks in the top 3."
- "I have written letters for 8 PhD applicants in the past 3 years. [STUDENT] is among the strongest."
- "Of the 15 research assistants I have mentored, [STUDENT]'s work stands out for [specific quality]."

## Technical Content Handling

### Machine Learning Topics
- Use precise terminology: "convolutional neural networks" not "CNNs" on first mention
- Explain impact: "This reduced training time by 30% while maintaining accuracy"
- Appropriate depth: enough to show understanding, not overwhelming detail

### Code & Implementation
- Mention languages/frameworks: "Python and PyTorch"
- Describe scope: "2000-line codebase with comprehensive tests"
- Emphasize quality: "well-documented, modular design"

### Mathematics
- Reference when relevant: "strong linear algebra and probability background"
- Avoid unnecessary detail unless particularly impressive
- Connect to practical application

---

## Contextual Adjustments

### PhD vs MS Letters

**PhD letters emphasize:**
- Research potential and independence
- Intellectual curiosity and depth
- Ability to formulate and pursue novel questions
- Long-term trajectory and growth
- Contribution to specific research area

**MS letters emphasize:**
- Technical foundations and breadth
- Coursework performance
- Practical skills and project experience
- Readiness for advanced study or industry
- Professional qualities

### Time Constraints

If limited interaction:
- Acknowledge upfront: "While I have known [STUDENT] for only [SHORT_PERIOD]..."
- Focus on specific observations
- Avoid speculation about qualities you haven't observed
- Be honest about limitations: "I cannot speak to [his/her/their] research abilities..."

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-generalization**: Don't say "excellent communication skills" without a specific example
2. **Unexplained comparisons**: Don't say "one of the best" without context (best of what cohort?)
3. **Inappropriate enthusiasm**: Match recommendation strength to actual qualifications
4. **Redundancy**: Don't repeat the same quality in multiple paragraphs without new evidence
5. **Resume rehash**: Don't simply list activities; provide interpretation and assessment
6. **Vague praise**: Every positive claim needs a concrete example
7. **Ignoring weaknesses**: Address limitations honestly (if relevant) or acknowledge gaps in knowledge

---

## Stylistic Consistency Checks

Before finalizing any letter, verify:

- [ ] Every paragraph has a clear topic sentence
- [ ] Every positive claim is supported by specific evidence
- [ ] Comparisons include appropriate cohort/timeframe
- [ ] Technical terms are used precisely
- [ ] Sentence variety (not all starting with "The student...")
- [ ] Active voice predominates
- [ ] Tone is warm but professional
- [ ] No generic or clichéd phrases
- [ ] Letter length appropriate (500-700 words)
- [ ] Closing includes explicit recommendation strength
